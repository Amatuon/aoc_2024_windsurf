# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.

## Structure
- `src/`: Directory containing solution scripts for each day's challenge
- `inputs/`: Directory to store input files (if needed)

## Setup
Requires Python 3.8+

## Running Solutions

### Individual Day Solutions
Navigate to the specific day's solution and run the Python script.

### Run All Days
To run solutions for all completed days, use the `run_all_days.py` script:

```bash
python3 run_all_days.py
```

This script will:
- Dynamically import and run solutions for Days 1-25
- Print results for each day
- Handle missing day solutions gracefully
